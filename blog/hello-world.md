# Hello World

This is the first blog post in the blog folder. I look forward to posting many discussions here.

Here are a few Ideas I am toying with.

- Multiple GitHub accounts, windows and the Credential Manager
- The lion, the fox and the penguin -- using Brave, and FireFox on Linux
- Why not windows? Why I switched to Linux

Happy Reading
